# cs210-Project-3

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
      We had to read an input file and then create a program to count how many of each object was in the file.
    What did you do particularly well?
      creating the histogram to visually show how many of each item
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      I could enhance the python portion of my code. I created a new dictionary for each funcion, where I could possibly save some time by creating only one dictionary that is shared between all the functions
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
      The pieces of code that were most challenging was reading the frequency file that I created. For some reason it kept reading the last line twice. 
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
      The knowledge that I've gained on having C++ and Python work together. I can use the best aspects of each language for whatever problem arises.
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      I kept it readable and adaptable with good use of comments and functions.
